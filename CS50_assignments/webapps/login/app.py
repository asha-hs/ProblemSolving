# Sessions are how web servers remembers information about each user, which enables features like allowing users to stay logged in, and saving items to a shopping cart.
# These features require our server to be stateful, or having access to additional state, or information.
# HTTP on its own is stateless, since after we make a request and get a response, the interaction is completed.
# It turns out that servers can send another header in a response, called Set-Cookie:
# Cookies are small pieces of data from a web server that the browser saves for us.
# In many cases, they are large random numbers or strings used to uniquely identify and track a user between visits.
# In this case, the server is asking our browser to set a cookie for that server, called session to a value of value.
# Then, when the browser makes another request to the same server, itâ€™ll send back the same cookie that the same server has set before:
# Demonstrates the use of session to stamp every user who visits this page vertually and creates the illusion of per user storage
