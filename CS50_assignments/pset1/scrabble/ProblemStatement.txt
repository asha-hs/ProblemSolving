In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.

int POINTS[] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};
Notice that weâ€™ve stored the point values of each letter of the alphabet in an integer array named POINTS.
For example, A or a is worth 1 point (represented by POINTS[0]), B or b is worth 3 points (represented by POINTS[1]), etc.
For example, if we wanted to score the word Code, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the C is worth 3 points, the o is worth 1 point, the d is worth 2 points, and the e is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that Code is worth 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 points.
